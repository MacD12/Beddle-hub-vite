# Beddle Hub — About Page Update

- Refined `AboutSection.tsx` copy for a luxury, hospitality-first tone.
- Kept layout, classes, and styles intact (no design damage).
- Updated bullets to highlight: integrated PMS/Channel Manager/POS, human-feel automation, premium web & marketplace, and enterprise-grade support.
- CTA text: “Book a Private Demo”.
- Updated `index.html` title to “Beddle Hub — The Hospitality OS”.

> Route: `/about` (via React Router). Background image: `/public/about-dark.png` with softened overlay for contrast.
